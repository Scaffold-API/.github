# Scaffold Community Health Files

This repository acts as the foundation repository for GitHub configuration files that are **inherited (automatically) into all repositories in this organization**.

Read the [GitHub: Creating a Default Community Health File](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file) for more information on how this works.
